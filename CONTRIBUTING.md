# Welcome to the Pushup contributing guide

Welcome to the Pushup open source project. Whether you have already contributed
to Pushup, or are considering it, thank you! We appreciate you, your time,
and your effort. We're glad you're here.

My name is Paul Smith. I am the CTO and co-founder of [Ad Hoc][adhoc]. I
have been developing software and programming on the web since 1994. I still
enjoy it quite a bit. I also enjoy writing Go code, which I've done since
it was announced publicly in 2009. Since then, the combination of Go and
the web has been an important part of my life and career. I think Go can be
an even better web development environment and platform than it already is,
and that's why I started Pushup.

The goal of Pushup is to make the best web development tool for the Go
programming language.

Before you read any further, please read the Pushup [Code of Conduct][coc].

Here are the important resources you need to know what kind of work is
currently happening on Pushup.

 - [README][readme]
 - [Roadmap][roadmap]

The best way to communicate with the Pushup project developers at the
moment is:

 - [GitHub issues][issues]

(Coming soon: Discord, email, etc.)

To submit changes of any type, please start by creating an issue on GitHub. We
can discuss it in the comments. Then, open a pull request referencing that
issue, if there are source changes to review.

Good first bugs for contributors are issues on GitHub tagged with
"documentation" and "good first issue".

Since Pushup is a very new project, a good first bug might be to comment on
our README file: does it make sense? Do you understand the project? Is all
the information you need there? Are there any typos?

Reporting bugs: please stay on the lookout for any potential issue that
might cause problems for someone using Pushup. Your feedback on any issue, be
they design decisions or errors or performance, is very valuable to us. Err
on the side of opening that GitHub issue, it's cheap.

We value your time and work that you give to Pushup. Thank you for your
interest in contributing. We recognize contributors publicly (which you are
free to opt-out of).
