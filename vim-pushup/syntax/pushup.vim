" TODO: Implicit expressions are barely highlighted. It would be better if
" they were. Philosophically this syntax file defers to the go and html syntax
" files by marking those regions as transparent. However the go syntax barely
" highlights expressions by default. For now they are highlighted as a single
" color, which seems to be the better short-term trade-off. Two options for a
" longer-term fix:
"   * Take advantage of the limited syntax of implicit expressions and match
"     the contents with specific rules in this file. Potentially add an option
"     for whether to highlight the full expression as a unit versus
"     highlighting the sub-parts.
"   * Temporarily override some of the g:go_highlight_* config variables when
"     including the go syntax to ensure that sub-parts of the implicit
"     expressions are highlighted in pushup files even if they are not
"     highlighted in the user's normal go code.

" TODO: Many of the pushup expressions that are expected to be embedded into
" html are defined as top-level elements and also added to the htmlTop
" cluster. That is an intentional extension-point provided by the standard
" html syntax file. Since the <head> and <title> elements are constrained in
" what can be included, the @htmlTop cluster is not contained within them. In
" order to make pushup expressions highlight within those this uses
" containedin=htmlHead,htmlTitle. This would be better fixed by a patch
" upstream to introduce an additional extension cluster that could be matched
" within all elements that have a contains= option.
