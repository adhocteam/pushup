## Vim syntax file

This is a vim plugin for Pushup. It provides syntax highlighting. You should be able to symlink it into your plugin manager's path. Alternatively, to install it manually:

-   Locate or create a `syntax` directory in your vim config directory (Usually `~/.vim/syntax` for vim or `~/.config/nvim/syntax` for neovim)
-   Copy [`syntax/pushup.vim`](https://github.com/adhocteam/pushup/blob/main/vim-pushup/syntax/pushup.vim) into that directory
-   Locate or create a `ftdetect` directory in your vim config directory (Usually `~/.vim/syntax` for vim or `~/.config/nvim/syntax` for neovim)
-   Copy [`ftdetect/pushup.vim`](https://github.com/adhocteam/pushup/blob/main/vim-pushup/ftdetect/pushup.vim) into that directory
